# Common Bash Scripts

These are bash scripts that help you easily install certain applications or functionalities to your Linux Environment!

I will try to comment and explain what each piece of command does in order to keep everything public and open.

Note: I mostly dedicated this repository and these scripts to the users of ChromeOS whom can have trouble installing certain applications. However, most of these scripts
should work well in compatibility with other Debian-based flavors.

# How to use

**Step 1:** Download the appropriate file for the required action

**Step 2:** Launch your terminal (if necessary as some distros can simlply run a script by clicking on it), then if needed, `cd <directory of file>` 

**Step 3:** Use the command `bash <file>.sh` or `./<file.sh>` within your terminal then follow instructions of that script

# Additional Notes

This repository's scripts primarily uses the `apt` packager to install and handle tasks, but I will gladly incorporate the installation or usage of other packagers if necessary or if perferred by the user.
