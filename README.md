# Common Bash Scripts

These are bash scripts that help you easily install certain applications or functionalities to your Linux Environment!

I will try to comment and explain what each piece of command does in order to keep everything public and open.

Note: I mostly dedicated this repository and these scripts to the users of ChromeOS whom can have trouble installing certain applications. However, most of these scripts
should work well in compatibility with other Debian-based flavors.
