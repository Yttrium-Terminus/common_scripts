## Guide Begin

1. Head over to [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux)
2. Download the Community Edition, it should be in a file format of `.tar.gz`
3. Go to your terminal, if needed `cd` into the directory of the downloaded file. Then use the command: `tar -xf <downloaded_file>.tar.gz`
4. There should now be an extract file named something ideaIC-*, use this command: `cd <generated_folder>/bin`
5. Then we run IntelliJ with `./idea.sh`

For the script checkout the `intellij.sh` file within this same directory
